## Iris Data Set Analysis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

Background:
Ronald Fisher was a British Statistician and biologist.  In 1936 he wrote a paper called The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
Fishers Iris Data Set is a set of Data containing 150 pieces of data.  
The data is taken from 3 species of Iris flower.  4 different measurements were taken, the length and the width of the Sepal and the length and the width of the petal.

Through the Python programming language I will try to analyse this data calculating the following:
- The Minimum values of each data measurement set as a whole and as per each species of Iris flower.
- The Maximum values of each data measurement set as a whole and as per each species of Iris flower.
- The Mean values of each data measurement set as a whole and as per each species of Iris flower.
